 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jvmti/GetStackTrace/getstacktr006.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jvmti, noras]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     The test exercises JVMTI function GetStackTrace via breakpoint
 *     and consequent popping a frame.
 *     The test starts a new thread, does some nested calls, stops at breakpoint,
 *     pops frame, catches single step event and checks if the number of frames
 *     in the thread's stack is as expected and the function returns all
 *     the expected frames.
 * COMMENTS
 *     Ported from JVMDI.
